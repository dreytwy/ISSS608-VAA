<p>Entities are connected by edges to other Entities via an Event or Relationship node. The one exception to this is the Communication Event subtype, which is additionally linked to either an Event or Relationship node. The type field denotes the connector or edge type for the Entities, Event, and Relationship nodes. The edges are one of these: received, evidence_for, sent, NA.</p>

<li><p>For relationship as colleagues node or friends node, the node will have arrows/ edges pointing towards the relationship node.</p></li>
<li><p>For other relationships and events, the direction would be following the source and target.</p></li>
