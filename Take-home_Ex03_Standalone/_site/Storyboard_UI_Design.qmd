Our shiny app will look at network and temporal patterns, with the network graph as the core visualizations, with other tables and charts as accompanying visualization.

## **Website Look**

This would be the prototype of the layout structure with navbar at the top, and sidebar layout at the right side. Codes will be provided as well in panel-tabsets which will support interactivity for Quarto + Shiny visualisations.

## **Shiny Applications on Networks and Visualisations**

Our shiny compatible visualisations will have timeseries or related interative shiny compatible subnetworks or visualisations. These may include hovers or other clickable components.

-   We will be using `selectInput()`, `sliderInput()`, `plotOutput()`, etc to assist in the visualisations and interactivity.

## Inputs

The Shiny app will include some of these parts.

### Knowledge graph

As the entire network is very large, containing 1,159 nodes and 3,226 edges, it is not suitable to visualize the entire network. Hence, we will plot with subgraphs and other visualisations.

### Reference Node

For Nadia’s ego network, we require a reference node (Nadia).

### Network depth

In relation to the reference node, this serves to narrow down the network to view. The depth dictates how far from the reference node to network. As Nadia’s networks are at distance 1 or distance 2, we will add an option to toggle whether to render the full network or use the option to render by distance to the reference node.

## Outputs

### Plot area

Shows the network or visual plot. It will be interactive to enable closer inspection of network or visual elements.

These are some prototypes of the webpage and shiny application that we are planning to build for the project. The whole concept of this storyboard is mainly to allow the user to utilise interactive visualisations such as timeseries slides, clickable components, or hovers to get to the bottom of the activites brewing at Oceanus such as the Nemo Reef Operation. Hence, enhancing the whole user experience as they follow us along on uncovering the story.
