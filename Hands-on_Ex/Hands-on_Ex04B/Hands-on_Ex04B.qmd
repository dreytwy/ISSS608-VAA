# **4B. Visual Statistical Analysis**

## **4.1 Learning Outcome**

In this hands-on exercise, the learning outcomes are:

-   ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information,

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics, and

-   parameters package to visualise model parameters

## **4.2 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot**

[**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap10/img/image1.jpg){width="30"} is an extension of [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(magick)
img <- image_read("https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/statsExpressions/reference/figures/stats_reporting_format.png")
img_trimmed <- image_trim(img)
img_scaled <- image_scale(img_trimmed, "x700")  # Only specifying height, width auto-adjusts
img_scaled
```

## **4.3 Getting Started**

### **4.3.1 Installing and loading the packages**

In this exercise, **ggstatsplot** and **tidyverse** will be used.

The code chunk below will be used to load these R packages into RStudio environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

### **4.3.2 Data import**

For the purpose of this exercise, *Exam_data.csv* will be used.

In the code chunk below, [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package is used to import *Exam_data.csv* into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### **4.3.3 One-sample test: *gghistostats()* method**

In the code chunk below, [*gghistostats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

***Hypothesis***

H0: Mean of English score = 60

H1: Mean of English score != 60

::: panel-tabset
## The Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)+
  labs(title  = "One-sample Test on English Scores")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```

## The Code

``` r
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)+
  labs(title  = "One-sample Test on English Scores")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```
:::

***Conclusion***

Since BF = e\^-31.52, which is close to 0. We have significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean English score is not equal to 60.

### **4.3.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor**

-   A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

-   That’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

-   When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

```{r, echo=FALSE}
img <- image_read("https://r4va.netlify.app/chap10/img/image5.jpg")
img_scaled <- image_scale(img, "x100")  # Only specifying height, width auto-adjusts
img_scaled
```

-   The [**Schwarz criterion**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

### **4.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor**

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number.

One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
img <- image_read("https://r4va.netlify.app/chap10/img/image6.jpg")
img
```

### **4.3.6 Two-sample mean test: *ggbetweenstats()***

In the code chunk below, [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

***Hypothesis***

H0: Mean Math score for Male = Mean Math score for Female

H1: Mean Math score for Male != Mean Math score for Female

Alpha = 0.05

::: panel-tabset
## The Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)+
  labs(title  = "Two-sample mean test of Maths scores by Gender")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```

## The Code

``` r
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)+
  labs(title  = "Two-sample mean test of Maths scores by Gender")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```
:::

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

***Conclusion***

Since the p-value is \> 0.05, we don’t have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no statistically significant difference in the mean Math scores between Males and Females.

### **4.3.7 Oneway ANOVA Test: *ggbetweenstats()* method**

In the code chunk below, [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

***Hypothesis***

H0: There is no difference in English scores among races.

H1: There are differences in English scores among races.

Alpha = 0.05

::: panel-tabset
## The Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)+
  labs(title  = "One-way ANOVA test on English score by race")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```

## The Code

``` r
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)+
  labs(title  = "One-way ANOVA test on English score by race")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```
:::

-   “ns” → only non-significant

-   “s” → only significant

-   “all” → everything

***Conclusion***

Since p-value \< 0.05, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are differences in English scores among races.

### **4.3.8 Significant Test of Correlation: *ggscatterstats()***

In the code chunk below, [*ggscatterstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggscatterstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

::: panel-tabset
## The Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE
  )+
  labs(title  = "Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```

## The Code

``` r
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,

  marginal = FALSE
  )+
  labs(title  = "Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold'))
```
:::

***Conclusion***

The result indicates a statistically significant positive relationship (`r̂` = 0.83, p-value \<0.05) between English.

### **4.3.9 Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : *ggbarstats()* methods**

#### 4.3.9.1 Maths and Gender

In the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using [*cut()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut).

::: panel-tabset
## The Code

```{r}
exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)
```
:::

In this code chunk below [*ggbarstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association.

***Hypothesis***
